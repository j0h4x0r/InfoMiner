* A detailed description explaining
(a) which NYC Open Data data set(s) we used to generate the INTEGRATED-DATASET file
We used "Condominium Comparable Rental Income - Manhattan - FY 2009/2010" dataset (https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Housing-Development/DOF-Condominium-Comparable-Rental-Income-Manhattan/ad4c-mphb)

(b) what (high-level) procedure we used to map the original NYC Open Data data set(s) into our INTEGRATED-DATASET file
1. Remove uninteresting attributes.
Not all the attributes in the dataset are interesting. The attributes we *retained* in the dataset are:
(Attribute name starting with) MANHATTAN CONDOMINIUM PROPERTY: Boro-Block-Lot, Neighborhood, Building Classification, Total Units, Year Built, Gross SqFt, Est. Gross Income, Gross Income per SqFt, Full Market Value, Market Value per SqFt

2. Change of the attribute Boro-Block-Lot
We only retained the block number in this attribute. For example, if a Boro-Block-Lot value is 1-00007-7501, we will only keep the value 00007.

3. Rename the attributes
For simplicity, we remove the prefix "MANHATTAN CONDOMINIUM PROPERTY" from all the attribute names, and then remove spaces in the attribute names. We also rename "Boro-Block-Lot" to "Block". The final attribute names in our integrated data are:
Block, Neighborhood, BuildingClassification, TotalUnits, YearBuilt, GrossSqFt, EstGrossIncome, GrossIncomePerSqFt, FullMarketValue, MarketValuePerSqFt

(c) what makes your choice of INTEGRATED-DATASET file interesting
1. Why the dataset we selected is interesting?
The dataset is about the estimated rental income and market value of Manhattan condominiums. It also contains some basic information including address, classification, etc. of the condominiums. Thus we can find many meaningful patterns from this dataset. The dataset contains more than 1000 properties, covering all areas in Manhattan. So the information we find will be strongly supported.

2. Why some attributes are not interesting?
Attributes related to "comparable rental" are the statistics of similar rental properties that are used to value the condominium. While this part of the data is important for the evaluation, it is not interesting in our scenario here because these properties have similar physical features and location to the corresponding condominiums.

Since all the properties in the data are in Manhattan, the Boro number is always 1. And if we keep Lot number, then the "Block-Lot" is unique for each row. Thus only keeping Block number is enough.

Condo Section and Address are unique for each row, so their support will be very low when finding association rules. Thus it is meaningless to retain them. For address, if we just keep the street name, it will be similar to the block number, so it is sufficient to just keep the block number to indicate the address information.

3. What information can we expect to find from the data we extracted?
The attributes we select in our data including address information(block, neighborhood), building information(building classification, total units, year built, gross square feet) and value(gross income, market value). So potential information we may care about includes the relation between position and value, how the value varies for different building types, etc. We may also find the most frequent building type(s) in some areas.

* How to run?
Run the following command:
python main.py <INTEGRATED-DATASET> <min_sup> <min_conf>
The parameters are:
<INTEGRATED-DATASET> - the path of the integrated dataset CSV file
<min_sup> - the value of minimum support
<min_conf> - the value of minimum confidence

* Internal design of the project

* The command line specification of an interesting sample run

* Some significant additional information
